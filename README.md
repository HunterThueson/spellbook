# spellbook

A good wizard knows how to write many different kinds of spells. A great wizard knows she should only have to write it once.

`spellbook` is a library of useful programming constructs written by myself (Hunter Thueson). Its primary purpose is to help
me quickly add commonly-used functionality (such as `-h` and `--help` flags) to my own code. This library is not intended to
be "innovative" or unique; much of the code in this collection will probably be re-inventing the wheel at best and will likely
be inferior to software previously released from a different source. I'm fine with that. The biggest reason I'm creating this
library is to simply practice programming, after all.

The plan is relatively simple. I want to have several easy-to-access sub-projects within the larger `spellbook` that I can easily
import when I'm working on other projects. Each of these, in keeping with the themes of "magic" and "wizardry," will be called
a "tome." For instance, the library of `bash` code will be called `bash-tome`, the library of `rust` code will be called
`rusty-tome`, and so on and so forth. For the foreseeable future, each one of these "tomes" will be just a single file, but
in the future when they start to get cumbersome/overfull I will be sure to re-evaluate the idea of splitting them up into smaller
sub-sections. "Volumes," maybe? I haven't yet decided what I'll call them, but that's a problem for Future Me.
