# spellbook

A good wizard knows how to write many different kinds of spells. A great wizard knows she should only have to write it once.

`spellbook` is a library of useful programming constructs written by myself (Hunter Thueson). Its primary purpose is to help
me quickly add commonly-used functionality (such as `-h` and `--help` flags) to my own code. This library is not intended to
be "innovative" or unique; much of the code in this collection will probably be re-inventing the wheel at best and will likely
be inferior to software previously released from a different source. I'm fine with that. The biggest reason I'm creating this
library is to simply practice programming, after all.
